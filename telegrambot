ATTENTION - READ THIS BEFORE REGISTERING YOUR NFT.

Attention, to activate your NFT you must follow us on our social networks. Our team will check if you follow us before giving you your Electhrons, NFTs and rewards.

All the data that we will ask you for is public, but it will be safe with us, so don't worry, we will not share any of your data with anyone, especially the address of your wallet, so you can rest easy. 

We will only use the data that we are asking you to deliver everything you have earned, once this airdrop is over and we have enabled all the functions of our financial ecosystem. 

We will also use the data that we request so that you can check with your name user or the codes that you have obtained, the prizes that you have won. You can get more information at https://electhrons.github.io

If the NFT you are registering starts with ELTH****, you store 5 Electhrons, for each social network you follow with your accounts. Remember that you can only add one free NFT per social network. Free NFTs do NOT automatically accumulate electhrons, but you will earn electhrons by participating in our social media activities and free NFT lottery. So take a look at our social networks.

If you are registering an NFT that you have purchased, your NFT will accumulate 15 electhrons, when you register it, and 2 electhrons per week, until this airdrop ends. You'll also be automatically entered into the NFT Bought Lottery, where you can win Electhrons, NFTs, NFT 2.0, Metaverse Properties, Creatures, and many more prizes. So always check our social networks.

We recommend you read the "how to participate" document, available on our website electhrons.github.io, so that you know how this airdrop works. We also recommend you read our Whitepaper, so you know what we are building. We wish you good luck.
