ATTENTION - READ THIS BEFORE REGISTERING YOUR NFT.

Attention, to activate your NFT you must follow us on our social networks. Our team will review your if you follow us before giving you your Electhrons, NFTs and prizes.

All the data that we will ask you for is public, but it will be safe with us, so don't worry, we will not share any of your data with anyone. We will only use the data that we are asking you for, in order to deliver everything you have earned, once this airdrop is over, and we have enabled all the functions of our financial ecosystem. You can get more information at https://electrons.github.io

If the NFT you are enrolling starts with ELTH****, you store 5 Electhrons, for each social network you follow with your accounts. Remember that you can only add one free NFT per social network. Free NFTs do NOT automatically accumulate Electhrons, but you will earn Electhrons by participating in our social media activities and the lottery for free NFTs. So check out our social media.

If you are enrolling an NFT that you have purchased, your NFT will accumulate 5 Electhrons per week, until this airdrop ends. You will also automatically participate in the lottery for purchased NFTs, where you can win Electrons, NFTs, NFTs 2.0, properties in the metaverse, creatures and many more prizes. So always check our social networks.

We recommend you read the "how to participate" document, available on our website electrons.github.io, so that you know how this airdrop works. We also recommend you read our Whitepaper, so you know what we are building. We wish you good luck.
